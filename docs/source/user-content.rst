Create offline SOM
======================================= 
You can also create SOMs of your music collection on your own computer. ESRA is
built upon `apollon`_, an open source framework for audio feature extraction
and music similarity estimation. A user friedly and easy to use abstraction of
the apollon's functionallity is implemented in the `comsar`_ project.  Please
visit the `comsar documentation`_ for more information on installation and
usage.
