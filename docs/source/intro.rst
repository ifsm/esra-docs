What is ESRA
***************************************
The ESRA is concerned with the ongoing development of an online archive of digital
copies of the extensive collection of rare, often unique, historical
ethnographic sound recordings at the Institute for Systematic Musicology,
University of Hamburg.

The ESRA is aimed at safeguarding our audio heritage by providing
researchers in Systematic Musicology and Ethnomusicolgy as well as cognate
disciplines with high-resolution sound files and according metadata in a
semantically integrated and easily accessible format.

The collection of historical ethnographic sound recordings at the UHH Institute
of Systematic Musicology dates back to the year 1910 and comprises several
thousand individual recordings of music and speech from all parts of the world,
with a distinct emphasis on the musics of Africa and the Near and Middle East.

It is the stated aim of the ESRA to tranfer the sound on these often
fragile carriers into the digital domain with the utmost care, developing
proprietary methods of playback and digitization to ensure the highest possible
degree of fidelity to the source medium. The ESRA furthermore addresses the
requirement for sustainable and interoperable access strategies to sound
archivesâ€™ digitized holdings by developing novel methods of computational
analysis and advanced formats of representation of the archive's digitized
assets to provide researchers with state-of-the-art data to approach the
causative questions regarding similarities and divergences hidden in the deep
structure of the manifold manifestations of musical expression in the world.
