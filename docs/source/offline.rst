   Fill out the upload form to upload sounds into ESRA. Metadata are optional.

.. note::
   All music you upload, its metadata, as well as the respective audio features
   as extracted by ESRA are private to your account. Other users cannot see or
   play your music, or access it in any other way.


Create offline SOM
======================================= 
You can also create SOMs of your music collection on your own computer. ESRA is
built upon `apollon`_, an open source framework for audio feature extraction
and music similarity estimation. A user friedly and easy to use abstraction of
the apollon's functionallity is implemented in the `comsar`_ project.  Please
visit the `comsar documentation`_ for more information on installation and
usage.
